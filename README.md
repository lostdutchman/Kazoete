Ludum Dare is one of the world's largest and longest running Game Jam events. Every 4 months, they challenge creators to make a game from scratch in a weekend. For a list of our favorite games from LD41 or to play our game check out our [itch.io](https://itch.io/c/367646/ludum-dare-42) 

If you want to use this code base to make your own game feel free, it is absolutely free to use so long as you are not making a propaganda game(No racist, Sexist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Xenophobic.. Ect.. content. If you want to make that kind of trash then Iâ€™m not here to save you 72 hrs of work). Please also remove our logo/splash screen if you decide to publish this. If you need further clarification reach out to us.
